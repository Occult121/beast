<h4>Hong Kong is known the world over as a glamorous city and a top choice for luxury shopping. But this city-state is steeped in culture and history, and has a lot more to offer than mouthwatering dim sum and an impressive skyline.

Hong Kong has an energy about it that is hard to describe. Around every corner is something new and unique, whether it's an ancient temple, a shop selling the latest electronic gadget, or a man taking his bird in a cage for a walk.

Hong Kong has another side as well, where you'll find forest-covered mountains, hiking trails, beautiful beaches, islands, and traditional fishing villages.

As a Special Administrative Region of China, Hong Kong presents an interesting study in the influences of ancient Chinese culture, as well as its own attitudes and history, independent from that of mainland China.

Hong Kong is one of the most impressive cities in the world, certainly, but there's much more here than meets the eye. Find out what to see and do and discover the best places to visit with our list of top attractions in Hong Kong.</h4>

<figcaption><h2>Star Ferry</h2><br> 
Hong Kong's famous Star Ferry, with roots dating back to 1880, costs only a few Hong Kong Dollars to ride, making it one of the best deals in all of Hong Kong. Victoria Harbour is a hive of activity, and ships of all shapes and sizes chug, zip, or wallow past as the expert captains of the Star Ferries somehow avoid collisions.

As you travel the main route from Kowloon to Hong Kong Island, or more specifically, Tsim Sha Tsui (TST) to Central, it's hard not to be struck by the dense towers of Hong Kong Island, backed by green mountains rising up before you. The breeze off the water is exceptionally refreshing, and the wide-open spaces are a perfect antidote to the tight confines of the city.

Don't worry about scheduling a time to ride the ferry, they leave every few minutes all day long and later into the evening, so it's always easy to get a great seat in the front or along the rail. The return trip from Central to Tsim Sha Tsui is also just as impressive.

If you time it right in the evening, you can catch one of Hong Kong's Symphony of Lights shows. The 360-degree spectacle of laser beams striking the skyscrapers on either side of the harbor is one of the city's free attractions and one of the most popular things to do at night in Hong Kong.</figcaption></figure><br><br> 
<br> 
<a target="_blank" href="#Hong Kong has one of the most impressive and recognizable skylines in the world. The dense collection of skyscrapers, both on the island of Hong Kong and in Kowloon, combined with the surrounding mountains and harbor set this city apart.

In the harbor, traditional red-sailed Chinese junk boats and the historic Star Ferry contrast sharply with the backdrop of modern high-rises. At night, the skyline changes character completely as the sky darkens and the city lights fill the scene.

Two of the best places in Hong Kong to see the skyline are from the top of Victoria Peak or from the Kowloon waterfront (along the Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade near the clock tower), not far from the Star Ferry dock, where benches line the waterfront and look across to Hong Kong. The latter location is the best place to watch the nightly A Symphony of Lights laser and light show set to music.">Hong Kong has one of the most impressive and recognizable skylines in the world.

You haven't seen the best of Hong Kong until you've taken in the skyline from Victoria Peak, more commonly known as The Peak. Ride the tram to the top of this scenic viewpoint to see the skyscrapers, bustling city, harbor, and surrounding islands. It's best to sit on the right-hand side to get the best views on the way up.

The tram station is located near the entrance to Hong Kong Park by the Murray building. At the top of the tram are the Peak Tower and Peak Galleria, with shops, restaurants, and an observation deck. Most of The Peak is covered by a large park with lush greenery, nature trails, and more beautiful lookouts with views over the thriving metropolis below.

A trail also leads down from The Peak to the city below, following a mix of trails through the forest and sections of road here and there. It can be a bit confusing finding your way. See our article on Hong Kong hiking trails for more details.</figcaption></figure></div>

<figure><img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2018/10/hong-kong-attractions-big-buddha-and-forest.jpg" alt="g" style="width:100%;"><figcaption><h2>Big Buddha (Tian Tan Buddha Statue)</h2><br> 
The 34-meter-high "Big Buddha" sits above Lantau Island's Po Lin monastery, which was a fairly secluded place until the statue was built in 1993. This is one of the largest Buddha statues of its kind in the world and took 12 years to complete. The size is astounding, both up close and seen from a distance. The setting here is also incredible, surrounded by the green forest and views out over the ocean and islands.

Although you can take a bus, the best way to reach the Buddha is via the scenic Ngong Ping cable car, which takes you on a 5.7-kilometer, 25-minute ride over forest, water, and mountains. The ride terminates at the small tourist-focused Ngong Ping Village, which you'll have to walk through before reaching the monastery and Big Buddha. Once through the village, a huge set of stairs leads up to the base, but don't be daunted. The walk up goes quickly, and the views from the base of the statue are well worth the effort.

You can access the cable car from the MTR Tung Chung Station.</figcaption></figure></div>

<figure><img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/HK/hong-kong-wong-tai-sin-temple.jpg" alt="g" style="width:100%;"><figcaption><h2>Wong Tai Sin Temple</h2><br> 
The Wong Tai Sin Temple is one of the newest in Hong Kong and also one of the most interesting. Located in Kowloon, the original temple was a private structure built in 1920. It was later replaced with a newer building in 1968, which is what visitors see today.

The temple was built to honor the Taoist god Wong Tai Sin, whom locals regard as the bringer of good luck in horse racing and a healer of illnesses. A festival is held at the temple in Wong Tai Sin's name each fall.

The temple complex is made up of several buildings, including the Hall of Three Saints, the Good Wish Garden, and another hall dedicated to Confucius and his 72 disciples. Expect to see fortune-tellers in the large hall, as well as joss sticks and other offerings that visitors can use. It is customary for guests to leave a small donation toward the temple's maintenance.

Address: 2 Chuk Yuen Village, Wong Tai Sin, Hong Kong</figcaption></figure></div>

Not everyone thinks of beaches when they think of Hong Kong, but you don't have to go far to find some incredible stretches of soft sand. The beach at Repulse Bay is the most popular in all of Hong Kong, with beautiful views and a great place for swimming, although it's very non-touristy.

A day spent here is complemented by the luxury and style typical of Hong Kong itself. The street running along the oceanfront and overlooking the wide beach is lined with trendy restaurants and shops. Amalfitana is a fun place to enjoy a pizza, with casual open-air dining looking over the beach.

Another nearby spot for a day at the beach is Big Wave Bay. Here, the water rolls in relatively gently to a large U-shaped cove with a splendid beach. This is a much more relaxed and casual atmosphere than at Repulse Bay. A popular outing is to walk part of the famous Dragon's Back hike to Big Wave Bay and dip in the ocean for a swim.</figcaption></figure></div>

A stroll through the Temple Street Night Market is another one of those all-important things to do while you're in Hong Kong. Located in Kowloon, this is the place to go to taste eclectic foods and to shop for bargains on everything from clothing and trinkets to electronics and household goods. Vendors sell gadgets of every shape and size, as well as jade jewelry and traditional Chinese crafts.

This is the best market for tourists in Hong Kong, but you can find a number of other interesting street markets selling almost anything you can imagine. See our article on Hong Kong street markets to learn about markets to explore by day.

The market gets going around 6pm, but vendors are often slow to get set up, so it's best not to arrive too early. The MTR stop for the Temple Street Night Mark is Jordan Station, Exit A.</figcaption></figure></div>

<figure><img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2018/10/hong-kong-attractions-disneyland-fireworks.jpg" alt="g" style="width:100%;"><figcaption><h2>hong kong disney land </h2><br> 
Hong Kong Disneyland is located on Lantau Island. Here, you'll find a wonderful world filled with fun and fantasy populated with the cast and characters from Disney movies. The park is divided into seven lands: Adventureland; Fantasyland; Toy Story Land; Tomorrowland; Grizzly Gulch; Mystic Point; and Main Street, U.S.A.

Performances happen throughout the day in the various lands and feature everything from parades to musicals, right through to evening fireworks over the castle. Also on offer are a wide array of adventures, ranging from Jungle cruises to a trip to Tarzan's Treehouse, as well as water-based fun at Liki Tiki.

The park undertook significant renovations and upgrades in late 2019. One of the major highlights of this revitalization was the construction of the Castle of Magical Dreams. Here, your children can gaze in awe at wonders like Cinderella's Coach, Snow White's apple and Belle's rose. The new castle will also be the venue for daytime and evening musical shows and extravaganzas.

The second major upgrade is the addition of the Frozen area and the installation of the brand new ride called Wandering Oaken's Sliding Sleigh,</figcaption></figure></div>

      <h4 class="media-heading">Tai O Fishing Village</h4>
      
      <p>A visit to Tai O village offers an experience you won't find anywhere else in Hong Kong. Although it is a popular place to visit for tourists, it is a far cry from the busy city, crowded markets, and theme parks. Tai O is home to people who live a quieter, more traditional way of life.

The Tanka people who live in Tai O, found on Lantau Island, build their homes on stilts over tidal flats. Villagers offer boat rides around the village, after which you can visit the local markets and sample some of the fresh seafood. Occasional sightings of the endangered pink dolphin occur in the nearby waters. Many people visit Tai O village after they've made the journey up to the Big Buddha.</p>

      <h4 class="media-heading">avenue of stars</h4>
      
      <p>For an escape from the city towers to a wide-open space with a bit of culture thrown in, be sure to visit the Avenue of Stars. This is where the city pays homage to some of Hong Kong's best-known film stars. Similar to the Walk of Fame in Hollywood, the Avenue of Stars is dedicated to Chinese performers.

Closed for several years due to waterfront development, it has now reopened bigger and better than ever. The new walkway is curved and stretches farther out into Victoria Harbour than before, allowing fantastic views of Hong Kong Island. The Avenue of Stars is one of the best spots to catch the nightly laser show and see the neon lights shimmering across the water.

The famed handprints are back, along with two new impressive sculptures, one of Bruce Lee with a wonderful water feature and another of Anita Mui. Each night, just down the way, a water fountain dances and sprays water high into the air in a choreographed performance on a regular schedule.</p>

      <h4 class="media-heading">en Thousand Buddhas Monastery</h4>
      
      <p>Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery, located in Sha Tin, offers a beautiful and peaceful escape from the bustle of central Hong Kong and a look at the countryside. Set on a hilltop, the main access to the monastery is reached by walking up a long and curving set of stairs (approximately 400 steps), lined with hundreds of golden statues.

The walk is part of the attraction, and each of the statues is unique, many with quirky facial expressions and other interesting characteristics. Once at the top, the path opens into the square in front of the main temple, a welcome sight both because it's the end of the climb and for the impressive structures and statues that surround the open space.</p>
